# Bikesharing

## Overview of Project
### Purpose of Project
In this project, I demonstrated my proficiency with various Tableu features to create dynamic data visualizations using worksheets, dashboards, and stories to show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders, the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week, and the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

### Background of Project
After a trip to New York City, Kate and I decide we want to start a smiliar bike-share business in our hometown of Des Moines, IA. This Tableu report uses the August 2019 Citibike data to show a potential angel investor how the bike-share program works in New York City so we can understand how a similar program will work in Des Moines.

## Results
All visualizations and descriptions of the results for the NYC Citibike analysis can be found on this [link to dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/shared/2D388S5TG?:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link).

## Summary
There is a high-level summary of the results and two additional visualizations are suggested for future analysis (5 pt)

The placeholder, a short hint that describes the expected value, is a useful visual affect for the user. However, it can be unclear what the table is displaying when the placeholders for unused filters remain after the initial filter is applied. My recommendations below, outline how to make the table easier to interact with and read.

# Bikesharing

## Overview of Project
### Purpose of Project
In this project, I demonstrated my proficiency with various Tableu features to create dynamic data visualizations using worksheets, dashboards, and stories to show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders, the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week, and the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

### Background of Project
After a trip to New York City, Kate and I decide we want to start a smiliar bike-share business in our hometown of Des Moines, IA. This Tableu report uses the August 2019 Citibike data to show a potential angel investor how the bike-share program works in New York City so we can understand how a similar program will work in Des Moines.

## Results
All visualizations and descriptions of the results for the NYC Citibike analysis can be found here.

The “Filter Search” allows users to search for UFO sightings by date, city, state, country, or shape. The search can be done using any combination of filters. For example, a user could search by just the state of Oregon, just triangle shaped UFOs, or by a combination of the state of Oregon and triangle shaped UFOs.  

### FORMATING 
* Date is entered as MO/DA/YEAR
* State and Country are entered using their two letter abbreviations 

### HOW TO SEARCH 
ADD FILTER 
* Choose any filter  
* Type your criteria 
* Hit Enter [table will adjust] 
* OPTIONAL: repeat for remaining filters


REMOVE FILTER 
* Choose filter you want to remove
* Delete text
* Hit Enter [table will adjust]

    

### EXAMPLE
**Example 1: You want to search for sightings in the state of Oregon**
ADD FILTER 
* Choose any filter = "I want to search by the *state* of Oregon."  
* Type your criteria = The abbreviation for Oregon, "or", is typed under "Enter a State". 
* Hit Enter = The table will look like the image below.

**Example 2: You want to adjust your search so the table displays sightings in the state of Oregon that were in the shape of a triangle**
ADD ANOTHER FILTER 
* Choose any filter = "I want to add triangle to the *shape* filter."  
* Type your criteria = Type "triangle" under "Enter a Shape". 
* Hit Enter = The table will look like the image below.

**Example 3: You want to adjust your search so the table displays sightings that were in the shape of a triangle**
REMOVE FILTER 
* Choose filter you want to remove = "I want to remove the *state* of Oregon."  
* Delete text = Delete "or" typed under "Enter a State". 
* Hit Enter = The table will look like the image below.

## Summary
There is a high-level summary of the results and two additional visualizations are suggested for future analysis (5 pt)

The placeholder, a short hint that describes the expected value, is a useful visual affect for the user. However, it can be unclear what the table is displaying when the placeholders for unused filters remain after the initial filter is applied. My recommendations below, outline how to make the table easier to interact with and read.
